# Printer Machine System - Digital Logic Design Project Overview

## Introduction
This project entails designing a digital logic circuit for a printer machine system, incorporating various user interactions and functionalities, such as password protection, printing preferences, and pricing calculations.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Integrates a password-based system to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Printing Preferences**: Allows users to select between color or grayscale, and portrait or landscape printing options.
- **Copy Counting and Pricing**: Utilizes a counter to track the number of copies made and calculates the printing cost accordingly.
- **Display Components**: Employs two one-digit and one two-digit 7-segment displays to show copy numbers and printing costs.
- **System Control**: Includes mechanisms like a PRESET and CLEAR button to manage the copy count and system reset.

## Technical Requirements

- **Logic Design**: Design and implement the logic circuit that governs the printer system using digital logic principles.
- **Component Specification**: Specify the necessary system components such as switches, displays, comparators, and counters.
- **State Management**: Develop state diagrams and timing diagrams to depict the behavior of the system under various conditions.

## Objective

To construct a comprehensive logic diagram that accurately represents the operations of a multifunctional printer system, highlighting the integration of digital logic components to control and display the system status effectively.

## How to Use

- **System Initialization**: Activate the system using the power switch and enter a valid password to access the printing functionalities.
- **Setting Preferences and Printing**: Choose the desired printing and layout properties, input the number of copies, and start the printing process.
- **Monitoring and Resetting**: Monitor the ongoing operations through the digital displays and use the PRESET and CLEAR buttons as needed to manage the system.

This README outlines the design and operation of the Printer Machine System for educational purposes and practical implementation in digital logic design.
